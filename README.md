## Running the Application
This App was created with React and SASS, you'll need npm to run this application. You can find the latest version of npm/nvm [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). There are instructions there for installing it on the page as well. Once that's installed:
- Download, unzip, then navigate to the project directory
- Once inside the directory run 'npm install'

Once npm is done installing everything type 'npm start' to run the application.

## Features
This application consists of a form for user or account creation.
Occupation and state options are pulled from an API and then used in dropdown menus. The user won't be able to submit the form unless everything is filled out correctly. Upon creating their account a user is shown an account created page, if a backend was attached to this I'd have it bring the user to their account page. Other features include:
- Basic Email Validation
- Password Validation
- Responsive Error Handling
